      </p>

      
      <p style="text-align:left; ">The acquisition of a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-workspace-individual/answer/10758077?hl=en">Google Workspace </a> Individual subscription is nonrefundable, with the exception of the countries and regions specified in the Partial Refunds section. Throughout the duration of your subscription period, you maintain access to the Google Workspace Individual features, even in the event of cancellation.

      </p>
      </br>
      <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 25px; ">Google Workspace Renewal Policy</p>

      <p style="text-align:left;">Google Workspace users are required to renew their subscriptions annually to prevent any interruption or cancellation of their services.
</p>
</br>
      <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 25px; ">What if auto-renewal fails</p>
      
      <p style="text-align:left;">The major reason for payment failure for the Google for Workspace or your GSuite account would be mainly because the RBI changed the regulation for online payment authentication. Online automatic payments in India have been limited to ₹5,000. If renewal payment for your Google Workspace account gets stuck or fails, that may hamper your Google Services operation.
</br>


<a href="https://support.google.com/pay/india/answer/11040246?hl=en">Changes to automatic payments in India as per RBI regulations have been notified by Google.

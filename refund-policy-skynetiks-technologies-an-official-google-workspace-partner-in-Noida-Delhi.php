    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Once cloud software and products are sold, they cannot be exchanged under any circumstances. 
      Regrettably, we do not provide refunds or exchanges for any software or product purchases.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Workspace Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The acquisition of a Google Workspace Individual subscription is nonrefundable, with the exception 
      of the countries and regions specified in the Partial Refunds section. Throughout the duration of 
      your subscription period, you maintain access to the Google Workspace Individual features, even in 
      the event of cancellation.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Workspace Renewal Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Google Workspace users are required to renew their subscriptions annually to prevent any interruption 
      or cancellation of their services.
    </p>

    <h2>What if auto-renewal fails</h2>
    <p>
      The major reason for payment failure for Google Workspace or your GSuite account is due to new RBI 
      regulations for online payment authentication. Online automatic payments in India have been limited 
      to â‚¹5,000. If renewal payment fails, it may hamper your Google Services operation.
    </p>

    <div class="policy-highlight">
      Changes to automatic payments in India as per RBI regulations have been notified by Google.
    </div>

    <p>Other reasons for payment failure may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The payment has been declined by your credit card provider.</li>
      <li>The credit card provided has expired or has insufficient funds.</li>
      <li>The credit card number provided is invalid.</li>
      <li>The credit card provided has not been approved for recurring payments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Please contact your bank or credit card company to check why the payment failed and update your payment 
      details accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>If the subscription is canceled</h2>
    <p>
      Users will retain access to their Google Workspace Individual features throughout the subscription period. 
      However, once the subscription ends, users will no longer have access to any Google Workspace Individual features.
    </p>

    <h2>Need Help?</h2>
    <p>If you face any of the following problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Workspace Renewal Payment Failed</li>
      <li>Google Workspace Subscription Canceled</li>
      <li>Google Workspace Free Trial Sign Up</li>
      <li>Google Workspace India Support</li>

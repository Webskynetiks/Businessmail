We have been a client of Skynetiks for over 10 years, and their services have been consistently flawless. We've never encountered any issues, and their support team is incredibly cooperative and helpful. We wish them all the best and thank them for being such a reliable partner.

        The team at Skynetiks is supportive, responsible, and communicative. Their process-oriented approach, which includes a strict data compliance policy, creates hurdles at times. All sensitive information requests must be sent by email; else, they won't respond, a clear sign of professionalism. It shows they take data security seriously. I have already recommended them to others.

We have a dedicated IT team at Patanjali, and we've worked with Skynetiks to manage our cloud and other SaaS services. We've been fairly OK with their support and services. On a scale of 10, we'd give them a 9, as they are a dependable partner. We can fairly recommend them.

I learned the hard way that dealing with freelancers can be a nightmare. Skynetiks might cost a bit more, but their 20+ year track record and the peace of mind that comes with it are priceless. I highly recommend looking at a company's longevity before you buy.       </p>

What I really appreciate about Skynetiks is their excellent ticket-based support system. It gives me peace of mind knowing that every request is monitored and tracked, ensuring I get timely service and a satisfying resolution. The option to rate the person who helped me is a great feature. This kind of systematic, professional approach shows that their quality of service isn't dependent on one person but on a well-run system. It's a huge factor in why I trust them.

Skynetiks is not a service provider; they're our trusted consultant. Their genuine approach has helped us save money and optimize our costs for over a decade. It's a relationship built on trust, not sales. We've been with them for 10+ years, and that speaks for itself

We wanted a file sharing system which was costing huge. They optimized the cost and plugged in some solution to save our cost and reduced it to 35%. The data was to shared with multiple stake holders securely for our Public Listing. Thanks we are a listed company today and a credit although little also goes to Team Skynetiks. 
Thanks you

I believe in working with a technology partner, not just a service provider. That's exactly what we get with Skynetiks. They don't just wait for us to ask for something; they proactively act as an extended arm of our tech team, offering suggestions for process improvements. Wishing them all the best!

We don't have a big IT team, but we don't need one because Skynetiks is our IT team. They take complete ownership, ensuring none of our services expire by sending automated reminders to prevent any disruption. On a few occasions, they've even paid the principals themselves when we were traveling and couldn't. This level of dedication is why we trust them completely. Thank you for all your support

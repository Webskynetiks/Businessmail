                <b>Answer:</b> To set up Google Workspace, start by signing up through the official Google Workspace website. During registration, you’ll either purchase a new domain or use your existing one. Once registered, you'll need to verify your domain ownership by adding a TXT or CNAME record to your domain's DNS settings. After verification, configure the MX records to route your emails through Google’s servers. You can then create user accounts for your team and access business email via Gmail. If you're unfamiliar with DNS configuration or email setup, partners like Skynetiks Technologies can handle the full setup and onboarding for you.

              <div class="card-body">
                <b>Answer:</b> To ensure that your emails are delivered correctly and securely, you must configure several DNS records for Google Workspace. The essential records include MX records to direct mail flow to Google's servers, an SPF record to authorize Google as a sender, DKIM to digitally sign your messages, and DMARC to protect your domain from spoofing. Setting up these records ensures proper authentication and improves your email deliverability.

              <div class="card-body">
                <b>Answer:</b> To get started with Zoho Mail, register for a Zoho Workplace account and add your domain during setup. You'll be asked to verify ownership of your domain by adding a TXT record to your DNS provider. After successful verification, you must update the MX records to point to Zoho's mail servers. Then, configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to enhance email security and deliverability. You can manage users and mailboxes from Zoho’s admin console. Once everything is set, users can start sending and receiving emails using Zoho’s webmail interface or their preferred mail clients.

              <div class="card-body">
                <b>Answer:</b> Zoho Mail requires you to add specific MX records to your DNS to route mail through its servers. Additionally, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records should be configured to authenticate your outgoing emails and protect your domain against spoofing or phishing attempts. Zoho provides these DNS records in the admin dashboard, along with step-by-step guidance for applying them at most major domain registrars.

              <div class="card-body">
                <b>Answer:</b> Setting up Microsoft 365 starts with purchasing a business email plan through Microsoft. After signing in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, you’ll need to add your domain and verify ownership through DNS (usually via a TXT record). Once verified, Microsoft will provide you with DNS records including MX, SPF, CNAME, and sometimes SRV records, which you must add to your domain’s DNS settings. These records ensure proper email routing and configuration of services like Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive. After the setup is complete, you can create mailboxes for your users and access email through Outlook Web or desktop/mobile apps.

                <b>Answer:</b> Microsoft 365 setup involves adding several DNS records to your domain’s control panel. These include an MX record to direct emails to Microsoft servers, an SPF record to validate sending sources, DKIM and DMARC for email authentication, and CNAME records for services like autodiscover and SIP. These configurations ensure a seamless experience with all Microsoft email and collaboration services while maintaining domain security and compliance.
